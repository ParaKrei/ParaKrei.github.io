		<p>This is a game I made in my free time. It started out as a simple framework, and then grew into the full game it is today.</p>
		<p>The game was created with Scratch. I plan to port it over to LÃ–VE for a more portable and faster experience.</p>
		<p>This is the original version of the game, before I revamped the level system and scaling. This version is much harder.</p>
		<p>You can check out the game under this text!</p>
