# Hello, everyone!
This is my personal website, where I will host my projects, along with any other websites I create.
I will build this site with **[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)**, as I want to create a small website quickly, and I have no time to learn HTML (yet)... wait...
#### Welp.
Nevermind, I guess I will learn HTML, since WordPress requires some things that I currently do NOT have access to, and it needs to be installed on the website.
